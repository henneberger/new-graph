# new-graph

`new-graph` is a prototype graph query planning crate. It adds graph-language
frontends and graph-aware planning on top of a relational optimizer stack, with
the long-term goal of lowering graph operations into SQL islands that can run on
ordinary SQL engines.

The project is currently implemented in Rust. It contains parsers, ASTs,
semantic lowering, a Graph IR, planner facades, a small interpreter, and adapter
code that represents Graph IR operators as relational extension nodes. The
design target is Calcite-style planning: keep graph semantics explicit while
allowing relational optimization and SQL island generation where graph operators
can be safely expressed as SQL.

## What This Project Does

`new-graph` is exploring this pipeline:

```text
Cypher / Gremlin frontend
  -> parser and language AST
  -> semantic lowering
  -> Graph IR logical plan
  -> graph rewrites and relational optimizer integration
  -> SQL islands
  -> SQL engine execution
```

The main idea is that graph languages should not be translated directly into one
large SQL string. Instead, the planner preserves graph operations such as node
scans, edge scans, expands, path semantics, traverser semantics, filters,
projects, aggregation, optional matches, repeats, and apply-style subqueries in
a graph-specific IR. Later passes can then decide which regions are relational
enough to lower into SQL islands and which regions need graph-native execution.

## Current Status

Implemented pieces include:

- Cypher and Gremlin language modules with AST, parser, semantic, and planner
  code.
- Committed ANTLR-generated parser bindings for Cypher and Gremlin, so normal
  Rust builds do not require Java or ANTLR generation.
- A shared Graph IR under `src/ir` with graph operators, expressions, catalog
  types, execution policy, and plan formatting.
- Public planner facades under `src/planner` for lowering Cypher and Gremlin
  planner-input ASTs into Graph IR.
- A Graph IR interpreter backed by Apache Arrow data structures for local test
  execution.
- A DataFusion logical-plan adapter under `src/ir/df.rs`, used to model how
  graph operators can participate in relational optimizer rewrites.
- Transform rules under `src/transform` for graph plan normalization.
- Case runners and integration tests for Gremlin/TinkerPop and Cypher/Ladybug
  corpora.

Some pieces are intentionally still in progress. In particular, full SQL-island
lowering and full language coverage are active development areas.

## Build

Install a recent Rust toolchain with edition 2024 support, then build the crate:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run narrower test targets while iterating:

```bash
cargo test --test planner_integration
cargo test --test hep_optimization
cargo test --test gremlin_planner
```

The repository commits generated parser modules under `src/grammar/generated`,
so a normal build should only need Cargo and the Rust toolchain.

## Design Notes

The Graph IR is meant to be the contract between language frontends and later
optimization/lowering stages. It tracks language-specific semantics that are
easy to lose in direct SQL translation, including result shape, multiplicity,
missing-property behavior, path mode, match mode, and traverser behavior.

The SQL-island direction is to identify subplans that can be represented as
relational SQL, lower those subplans, and leave graph-specific operators intact
where SQL would be incorrect or too awkward. This is the layer that is expected
to integrate with Calcite-style planner rules as the project matures.

For examples of the intended logical operators and semantic policy model, see
